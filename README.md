# about

### description

This repo holds a simple K/V store implemented in Go, backed by the Raft consensus algorithm for distributed consensus and cockroachdb/pebble for robustness

It is intended to be run behind a Service within a Kubernetes cluster, more work on that front will be happening once I get my on-prem cluster running
